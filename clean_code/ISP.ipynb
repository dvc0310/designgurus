    "### Problem: Appliance Control System\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with developing an appliance control system for various home appliances. The system should control devices like **Washing Machines**, **Refrigerators**, and **Lights**. Some appliances have features like turning on/off, adjusting temperature, or starting specific cycles. However, not all appliances have every feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Appliance**: This is the base interface that all appliances inherit. The current design has methods for `turn_on()`, `turn_off()`, `set_temperature()`, and `start_cycle()`. \n",
    "2. **Washing Machine**: Can be turned on/off and can start a washing cycle (but doesn't have temperature control).\n",
    "3. **Refrigerator**: Can be turned on/off and has temperature control (but doesn’t have a cycle).\n",
    "4. **Light**: Can be turned on/off, but doesn’t have temperature control or any cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Write Initial Code**: Start by writing the initial code that **violates the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**. This design should have an `Appliance` interface that forces all appliances to implement every method, even if not all methods are relevant to every appliance (e.g., forcing a `Light` to implement `set_temperature()` or `start_cycle()`).\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Identify the Violation**: Explain why this violates ISP when certain appliances are forced to implement methods they don’t use.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Refactor the Design**: Refactor the class hierarchy to comply with the **Interface Segregation Principle** by creating more specific interfaces for different types of appliances.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Implement the Refactored Code**: Write the refactored code where appliances implement only the interfaces that are relevant to their functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use multiple smaller interfaces for different functionalities (like `OnOffControl`, `TemperatureControl`, and `CycleControl`).\n",
    "- Appliances should only implement the interfaces they actually need, preventing irrelevant methods from being forced on any appliance."

    "### **Problem: Notification Service**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with developing a notification system that sends messages via different channels like **Email**, **SMS**, and **Push Notifications**. The current design tightly couples the `NotificationService` class with specific implementations of message senders.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Initial Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **NotificationService**:\n",
    "   - Has a method `send_alert(message)` that sends an alert message to users.\n",
    "   - Directly instantiates and uses concrete classes like `EmailSender`, `SMSSender`, and `PushNotificationSender`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Message Sender Classes**:\n",
    "   - **EmailSender**: Sends messages via email.\n",
    "   - **SMSSender**: Sends messages via SMS.\n",
    "   - **PushNotificationSender**: Sends messages via push notifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Tasks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Write Initial Code**:\n",
    "   - Write the initial code that **violates the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** by having the `NotificationService` depend directly on concrete classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Identify the Violation**:\n",
    "   - Explain why this design violates DIP and how it can lead to issues when trying to extend or maintain the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Refactor the Design**:\n",
    "   - Refactor the code to comply with the **Dependency Inversion Principle**.\n",
    "   - Introduce abstractions (e.g., interfaces or abstract classes) so that high-level modules do not depend on low-level modules but both depend on abstractions.\n",
    "   - Use dependency injection to supply the dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Implement the Refactored Code**:\n",
    "   - Write the refactored code with the new abstractions and show how `NotificationService` can work with different message senders without changing its code.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Demonstrate Extensibility**:\n",
    "   - Add a new message sender class, such as `SlackSender`, without modifying the `NotificationService` class.\n",
    "   - Show how the new sender can be integrated into the system seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Hints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:\n",
    "  - **High-level modules** should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.\n",
    "  - **Abstractions** should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Interfaces or Abstract Classes**:\n",
    "  - Define an interface (e.g., `MessageSender`) that declares a `send(message)` method.\n",
    "  - Concrete message sender classes implement this interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Implement Dependency Injection**:\n",
    "  - Instead of instantiating concrete classes within `NotificationService`, inject the dependencies through constructors or setters.\n",
