    "# Problem: Shape Drawing System\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with developing a system for drawing various shapes. The base class is `Shape`, and there are different shape subclasses like `Circle`, `Square`, and `Line`. The `Shape` class has a method `draw()`, which all subclasses must implement. Some shapes, like `Circle` and `Square`, also have an `area()` method because they have an area, but a `Line` does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Requirements:\n",
    "1. **Shape Class**: All shapes must implement a `draw()` method that defines how the shape is drawn on the screen.\n",
    "2. **Circle and Square**: Both of these shapes must also have an `area()` method because they have a measurable area.\n",
    "3. **Line**: A line can be drawn, but it does not have an area.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Code**: Start by writing the initial code that does **not** adhere to the Liskov Substitution Principle. Include all shapes inheriting from `Shape`, with each implementing `draw()` and `area()`, even if `Line` doesn't have an area.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Identify the Violation**: Explain why this violates the LSP when `Line` is substituted for a `Shape`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Refactor the Design**: Refactor the class hierarchy so that all shapes can be substituted for `Shape` without violating LSP. Use proper abstractions to ensure only shapes with an area implement the `area()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Implement the Refactored Code**: Write the refactored code where the design adheres to LSP.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use abstract base classes (interfaces) to segregate shape-related responsibilities, such as drawing and calculating the area.\n",
    "- Ensure that only shapes capable of having an area (like `Circle` and `Square`) implement the `area()` method, while shapes like `Line` do not need to implement this method."
