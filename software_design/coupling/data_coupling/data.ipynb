    "**Data coupling** occurs when modules share data through parameters, and the only requirement is that the data passed between them is of a specific type or format. This is one of the more desirable forms of coupling because it provides a clear interface for how modules interact, but it does mean that the modules are connected through the specific data they share.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Scenario:\n",
    "Consider a simple system with a `ReportGenerator` class that generates reports and a `ReportPrinter` class that prints the reports. These two modules interact by sharing a data structure representing the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Example of Data Coupling:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `report_generator.py`\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ReportGenerator:\n",
    "    def generate_report(self):\n",
    "        # Generates a report as a dictionary (or could use a data class)\n",
    "        report = {\n",
    "            'title': 'Sales Report',\n",
    "            'content': 'The sales report shows an increase in revenue by 20%.'\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        return report\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `report_printer.py`\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ReportPrinter:\n",
    "    def print_report(self, report):\n",
    "        # Expects the report parameter to have 'title' and 'content' keys\n",
    "        print(f\"Report Title: {report['title']}\")\n",
    "        print(f\"Report Content: {report['content']}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `main.py`\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from report_generator import ReportGenerator\n",
    "from report_printer import ReportPrinter\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create instances of the generator and printer\n",
    "generator = ReportGenerator()\n",
    "printer = ReportPrinter()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generate and print the report\n",
    "report = generator.generate_report()\n",
    "printer.print_report(report)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- **Data Coupling**: The `ReportGenerator` and `ReportPrinter` classes are coupled through the `report` data structure, which is passed as a parameter. The `ReportPrinter` expects the `report` to have a specific format (i.e., it must have `title` and `content` keys).\n",
    "- **Clear Interface**: The coupling is clear because the interaction happens through the `report` parameter, and no module relies on internal details of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Issues with Data Coupling:\n",
    "1. **Data Format Dependence**: If the format of the `report` dictionary changes (e.g., renaming `content` to `body`), any module that interacts with this data must be updated to match.\n",
    "2. **Assumptions about Structure**: The `ReportPrinter` class assumes the `report` parameter will always have the required keys, which can lead to errors if the data structure is not validated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improving Data Coupling with Data Classes:\n",
    "To make the code more robust and type-safe, you can use a data class to represent the `report` structure, ensuring that both modules share a common, well-defined type.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using a Data Class (`report.py`):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from dataclasses import dataclass\n",
    "\n",
    "@dataclass\n",
    "class Report:\n",
    "    title: str\n",
    "    content: str\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Updated `report_generator.py`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from report import Report\n",
    "\n",
    "class ReportGenerator:\n",
    "    def generate_report(self):\n",
    "        return Report(title='Sales Report', content='The sales report shows an increase in revenue by 20%.')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Updated `report_printer.py`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from report import Report\n",
    "\n",
    "class ReportPrinter:\n",
    "    def print_report(self, report: Report):\n",
    "        print(f\"Report Title: {report.title}\")\n",
    "        print(f\"Report Content: {report.content}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Using Data Classes:\n",
    "- **Type Safety**: Using a data class ensures that the `report` has the expected attributes and types, reducing runtime errors.\n",
    "- **Clear Contracts**: Both the `ReportGenerator` and `ReportPrinter` use the `Report` data class, making the interaction contract explicit and easy to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "**Data coupling** is a moderate level of coupling where modules interact by sharing data through parameters. It's a more desirable form of coupling because it maintains a clear boundary between modules and only requires them to agree on the type or format of data they exchange. By using a data class, you can enhance this type of coupling to be more robust and type-safe, making your code easier to maintain and extend."
