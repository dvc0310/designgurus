    "### Problem 1:\n",
    "You are tasked with creating a **logging system** for a web application. This logging system needs to ensure that only one instance of the logger is used throughout the application to avoid redundant logging resources and ensure consistent logging across various modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Requirements:\n",
    "1. The logging system should allow other parts of the application to log messages (error, warning, and info) but there should only ever be one instance of the logger.\n",
    "2. Ensure that the logger can write logs to a file (you can simulate this by writing to the console for now).\n",
    "3. The logger should also have methods like `logInfo()`, `logWarning()`, and `logError()` that each format the log message appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task:\n",
    "1. Implement a `Logger` class using the **Singleton Pattern**.\n",
    "2. Create a function that simulates multiple parts of the web application (perhaps by calling different modules) and ensures they all use the same logger instance.\n",
    "3. Demonstrate how the `logInfo()`, `logWarning()`, and `logError()` methods work within this Singleton logger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test your implementation by simulating log messages from various parts of the application and verifying that only one instance of the `Logger` class is created."
